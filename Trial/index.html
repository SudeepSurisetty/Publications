<p id="one">India is the world's second largest smartphone market, second only to China. 
It makes sense, then, that Google would want to push hard to sell its Pixel 2 phones in the region. 
According to a new report at The Economic Times, the company is planning to open brick and mortar retail stores in India to do just that.
</p>

<a name="Para2"></a><h3>Para 2 </h3>
<p> The report notes that Google is considering opening "experience centers" in the country, where customers can try out the Pixel 2 phones. 
One anonymous source said that the company might roll out the stores in later 2018, while another source said the company had added a senior 
Apple executive to its retail plans. Apparently, Google has been happy with the interest people in the region have shown in several pop-up stores 
in malls like High Street Phoenix in Mumbai and Select Citywalk, Promenade, Mall of India in Delhi-NCR. The Economic Times also reports that two other 
"prominent" malls in india have seen requests to open Google retail space. "They got a flavor of how physical stores are also important because you 
can't explain many of the features online," a top mall executive told the site.
</p>

 <a name="Para3"></a><h3>Para 3</h3>
<p> While Google hasn't confirmed the reports, setting up retail in India could help the company compete with Apple and Samsung, 
as well as Chinese-made phones from XIaomi, Vivo and Oppo, notes The Economic Times. We've reached out to Google for comment and 
will update this post when we hear back.
